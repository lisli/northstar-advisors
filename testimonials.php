          <h1>Testimonials</h1>
			<p><strong>Michael Throckmorton,</strong><br/> <em>Director, Construction Management of Universal Technical Institute said,</em><br/> &quot;The participation and effectiveness of Rosella Harvey and the rest of the NorthStar team over the last two years resulted in dramatic contributions to these successful UTI projects.  The relocation of programs as we expanded from two buildings to five buildings on two separate complexes was a considerable challenge.  To achieve this on a fast track, multiple prime contractor basis and in an aggressive budget circumstance was extraordinary.  Addressing a 'mass demolition' project immediately adjacent to and within active teaching areas for our on-going programs is atypical…the budget and an absolutely fixed class start date presented numerous obstacles for the overall team.  Rosella Harvey and Art Street addressed each of these with professionalism, a positive and proactive attitude, extraordinary good humor with an excellent balance of tenacity and sense of urgency.  The value provided by NorthStar cannot be overstated.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Ed Mutzer,</b><br/><em> A Resident of Academy House said,</em><br/> &quot;Ron Grace has been doing an excellent job representing us, the residents, during all these months of the Window Project. Ron has been very responsive to the residents' concerns. He has been very thorough in his evaluation of issues, asking questions, and resolution follow-up. He has been very professional. He truly has shown that he cares about resident issues and has represented us well with the main contractor Clemens. I wanted to mention this to you not only because of my own experience, but also through the experiences of other Academy House residents whom I've talked with. This email is a thank-you for a job well done by Ron Grace, and by you. Thanks for selecting Ron, and his company NorthStar, as Resident Coordinators.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Dr. James Capolupo,</b><br/><em> Superintendent of Schools for Springfield School District said,</em><br/> &quot;The Springfield Literacy Center is the first new school in Springfield School District in 50 years. It was very important for the project to be completed on schedule with a minimum of problems for our teachers, parents and students. NorthStar played a key role in making the project a huge success and helped us cross the goal line as winners. NorthStar was great to work with from day one to conclusion. They were visible on the property every day and ran a top notch operation.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Ms. Kimberly Hinkelman,</b><br/>
<em> Executive Director of  Cancer Support Community of Philadelphia said,</em><br/> &quot;Ray Diebel and NorthStar Advisors led us through a very complicated planning process for our project at The Wellness Community in West Fairmount Park. There were a multitude of participating partners, the project kept taking weird twists and turns along the way, and through it all Ray and his team were organized, professional, focused, diligent, timely and held it all together for us. We are now in the construction phase, and I cannot speak highly enough of this group of professionals. They understand the city, the state, the non-profit world, the construction business and most of all, human nature. He always had his eye on the client's needs and the fiscal and time restraints with which we were all working.&quot;</p>
<p><b>Mr. Joe Ferguson,</b><br/><em> Chief Operating Officer of Mastery Charter School said,</em><br/> 
&quot;Fantastic job, all! School started this week and I have enjoyed watching the eyes of students as they look at new walls, new paint, computers, and new furniture. Be very proud of your work.  It is never easy working with Mastery's tight budget and time constraints.  I know this.  But I also know that your work does not go unnoticed.  Our teachers, staff, and parents are huge fans of your work and the love for Mastery's children that our buildings visually represent every day.&quot;</p>
