          <p>	Renovation and restoration of Pickett and Lenfest campuses; operations, facilities, and cyclical maintenance planning of Thomas and Shoemaker campuses. Improved facilities and natural light resulted in improved test scores of students and a decrease in overall violence and poor behavior in the schools. </p>

<p>Harrity, Hardy Williams, Gratz, Smedly, Mann, and Clymer campuses involved renovations of the walls, floors and reception areas – including everything from new paint and carpet to new construction. NorthStar managed the renovations, including everything from painting and electrical work to the relocation and disposal of old furniture.</p>
