            <div class="teaser-photo"><a href="bio-street.php"><img src="../images/bio-cassey.jpg" alt="Ronald A. Street" width="100" height="100" /></a></div>

              <p>Dianna has proven successful in managing multiple projects, overseeing staff and completing projects on schedule and within budget. Her attention to detail, as well as her strong organizational and communicational skills, helps her deliver the quality each client expects, as well as the ability to become a quick team-leader. Her broad experience in management and real estate allows her to consistently think outside of the box, helping project solutions to be presented.</p>
              <p>Dianna&rsquo;s exceptional experience and ability to oversee multiphase construction projects gives her a great advantage over most other project managers, especially in the education field, where there are no exceptions to the budget or deadlines. She comes with over 10 years experience in renovation and construction management aimed specifically towards the education sector (mostly Philadelphia-area K-12). </p>
              <p>Dianna&rsquo;s extensive education and training in a widespread arena of topics, including everything from architecture, construction, real estate, and negotiating, allows her to take the lead in any situation, and makes her an incredible asset to any team she joins. </p>
