              <p>As a Senior Associate with NorthStar Advisors, Anne&rsquo;s responsibilities include coordination of project team members, budgeting, estimating, scheduling, program/operations management and move coordination.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s experience as a Project Manager includes working in the private sector for both large and small companies in capacities from building operations to department management.&nbsp; Her skills in working with people allow her to blend into an organization quickly, adapting to the personalities and culture of the company while helping people relax during a potentially stressful time.&nbsp; She brings her positive attitude with her as she meets the challenge of creating and maintaining a team atmosphere.</p>
              <p>Organized and focused on attention to details as well as managing projects that have a single phase to multi-phase relocations over the span of many months are equally enjoyable to Anne.&nbsp; The excitement and challenge of both diverse scopes of projects and groups of people is one of the rewards that foster Anne&rsquo;s can-do, enthusiastic work ethic.&nbsp; The pride she takes in her professional work is evident in the success of the projects!</p>
